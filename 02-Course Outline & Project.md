## Video and Projects link on udemy video

All right, guys.

So I just want to quickly outline the course and go over the projects that we're going to create.

So this is tailwind from scratch.

Com This is a website that I threw together just to kind of show you the projects and go over the outline.

And this is actually one of the themes that will be creating along with the, the light, light and

dark modes.

So if we go to the about section, there's three parts to this course really.

There's the code sandbox, which we'll be starting with.

And if you took my bootstrap course or my HTML, CSS course, then you know that a sandbox, what it

is, it's just a bunch of files to look at certain aspects of whatever we're working on in this case.

Tailwind.

So we'll have files for color classes and for typography classes.

Flexbox Just everything that Tailwind offers so we can get familiar with all of those class names.

And then once we do that, we'll move on to the mini projects.

We have five mini projects that will take anywhere from 10 to 20 minutes to complete just one video

straight through.

And then we move on to the six website projects, which are larger landing page projects with anywhere

from 8 to 10 videos each.

And the design for these were all inspired from the front end mentor website, which are they have all

kinds of challenge websites and they allowed us to pick some for the course to basically replicate using

Tailwind access.

So definitely check them out, check the actual projects out as well because there's some extra challenges

and so on.

But down here, let's see, course credits.

So of course I'm the the instructor and project developer.

Saba Kissy also worked on this course with me.

He created a bunch of these projects, so I want to give credit to him.

You can follow him on Twitter.

And of course Frontend Mentor is a collaborator for Project Inspiration.

So down here we have all 11 projects including the mini ones.

So these first five are the mini projects, first one being this email subscribe form.

So pretty simple, everything's going to be completely responsive, so it'll all look good on mobile

devices as well.

Then we have these pricing grids here and I'm just going to go through these real quick, a product

modal.

So some hover effects.

We have some animation on the the stock here, then we have the image gallery.

So simple image gallery and we have these hover hover effects where we can see the content.

We have a menu here and again, everything is going to be nice on mobile screens as well.

So the last mini project is this lagoon model.

So just a really cool looking lagoon form.

And then the first website project is this clipboard website, which is just kind of a landing page

for a software product.

We have some download buttons, no menu at the top or anything very simple but very clean looking.

So these images we have, you know, down here, we'll be using Flexbox and of course, it's going to

everything will stack and look nice.

Okay, then we have this Loop Studio's project and this is going to have a navigation menu at the top

with the hamburger menu on smaller screens.

So we will be writing some JavaScript for that.

There are a couple of things in these projects where we will be writing some JavaScript, but nothing

crazy.

Then we have these images here with a gradient overlay for our next project is this shortly website.

So it's a it's a website where you would create short links.

So we have this little form here.

We'll do a little bit of validation as well with JavaScript.

Then we have these boxes with a horizontal line and on smaller screens it'll be a vertical line.

We also have the cool looking hamburger menu as well.

Okay.

And then the next project is the testimonial grid.

So this in this project, we're going to use all CSU's grid classes, including Row Span and Call Span.

You can see some of these will span certain columns and rows and on small screens they'll all stack.

All right, then we have phyllo, which is actually the same theme for as the Tailwind from Scratch

website.

And we're going to include this dark light mode and we're actually going to save the state in local

storage.

So if you pick a mode and you leave the website and come back, it'll remember if you chose dark or

light mode.

All right.

So again, a little bit of JavaScript and just yeah, I think that these these website themes look really

clean, just testimonial boxes.

All right.

And then this project here, the bookmark website is for like a bookmark or manager app.

We have our navigation and again, this will have responsive now overlay navigation and we'll, we'll

write some JavaScript down here for these tabs so we can switch through these.

Okay then we have some download boxes.

Frequently asked questions for this.

We're actually not even going to need any JavaScript.

We're just going to use the the group focus feature.

And then just this part here.

All right.

Now, the code for all of these are on GitHub.

If I click this link.

This is private right now, but it will be public.

And it has all the live demos of all the projects.

It also has the the environments will be setting up as well, such as the Simple Tailwind starter,

which is just just that it's a simple environment to create and customize tail and websites.

And then I also created an optional video to show you how to use Tailwind along with web pack and post

CC.

So it's a little more advanced, but it's completely optional.

You don't even have to watch that video.

All right.

And then the sandbox is going to be a completely separate repository, which we'll get into in the next

section.

Okay, so that's it, guys.

Just wanted to kind of give you a preview of everything.

So next, we're going to just talk a little bit more about what tailwind is.
