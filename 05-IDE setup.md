All right, guys.

So I'm going to go over our environment, which is very, very simple.

When we're working with Tailwind and we're just working with HTML and CC, we'll write a little bit

of frontend JavaScript, but that's about it.

Now as far as the text editor you use, that's completely up to you.

I personally would recommend vs code for for just about anything really these days, any language.

It's very, very popular.

It's very intuitive.

It has great extensions.

It's easy to use.

It has an integrated terminal.

The list just goes on.

So it's definitely it's definitely a piece of software that I simp for big time so I would recommend

that it's it's cross-platform.

You're also going to need to install Node.js Joss JS on your system if you don't have it already.

And the reason for that is we're going to be using the node package manager to install Tailwind and

some other packages as well.

I'm going to give you an example of using Tailwind with Webpack, so you will need Node installed.

I'm sure that a lot of you already have installed, but if you don't just go ahead and download it,

go through the go through the installer, it's very simple and then you're going to need Git as well.

You should be using Git.

Now these projects are pretty simple, so if you don't use it for version control, that's okay.

But we will be deploying to Nat Lo Fi, we're going to be deploying to a service called Versatile and

to deploy to both of those we need to first push to GitHub.

So we will need Git for that and that's about it for actual programs that you need on your machine.

Now when it comes to voice code, there are a few extensions that I'm running that I would recommend.

So one would be live server.

And if you use voice code, I'm sure you know what live server is.

It basically just allows you to run any HTML file on just a local development server and it hot reload.

So any time you make a change it will update and make the change as well.

So we'll be using that all throughout the course and then there is a tailwind right here to an access

IntelliSense.

So I wouldn't I would suggest adding this it'll show you like the available classes even though in most

cases will be using Emit, which I'll talk about next.

But yeah, so this I would recommend it gives you certain highlights and stuff.

So get that installed.

And then also this postseason language support.

When we use directives, there's something called directives in when you're by default, you're going

to get some squiggly lines with an error message.

If you install this post CC language support plugin, then it's not going to show those squiggly lines.

And it also gives you some other, some other functionality too when it comes to post CC.

So I would recommend that prettier as a code formatter, that's something that I use.

It's really up to you if you want to use it and then.

Yeah, I'm pretty sure that's that's an auto rename tag.

So if you change the the ending tag like header to dev or something that it'll change the other one

as well.

But other than that, the extensions you use are completely up to you now if you're not familiar with

it, I'm sure most of you are.

But if you're not, it's a tool that allows you to write HTML a little faster and it comes standard

with as code.

But if you're using another text editor like let's say, Adam, I think that you have to install it

as a as a plugin or as an extension.

I don't think it comes automatically.

So one thing it will do is, is just if I want an H1 beginning and ending tag, I could just do H1 enter.

And the same goes for any, any element.

And if I want to put a class on, I could just do, let's say dot text, dash excel.

If I hit enter that will automatically be give me a div with that class.

If I wanted an H1 with the class of text dash whatever three Excel hit enter.

It'll give me an H1 with that class, so I will be using it quite a bit and they'll even be cases where

I want to put what I want to have like let's say ten divs with the text inside of item one.

So I might do something like this div.

We can open up some curly braces and say item and then number sign and then I could do multiply that

by ten, hit enter and then I get ten.

Divs Okay, so I think it's better than typing it all out.

Now the downside is if you're using the tail when ext you don't get the helpers to, you know, the

class names don't pop up the intellisense.

So it's really up to you.

On if you want to use Emit or not.

I will be.

So I just want to kind of let you know that also one thing that that can surprise people is when we

do write some JavaScript, there's very little, but we will be doing some JavaScript.

I don't use semicolons.

I also always use single quotes just to let you know.

So if you want to add semicolons, that's absolutely fine.

I just I tend not to use them in JavaScript, but other than that, I really can't think of anything

else as far as my configuration goes.

I guess we could take a look, actually, let's look at the JSON settings.

So if we do a command shift P and if you just search for JSON and you go to your Jason settings, so

my font size is 18 just so you guys can see it.

The terminal size is bigger too, wherever that is right here, terminal, that's also 18.

I don't have format on saves.

I do have that set to true format on save.

I don't have autosave enabled.

I'm using word wrap my tab size.

I have set two to.

And I don't think any of this other stuff.

Yeah, none of this other stuff really matters.

So, live server, Emmett, tailwind, plug in.

That's pretty much it as far as my my text editor environment.

All right.

So let's get on to the next video.
