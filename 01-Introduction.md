Hey.

What's going on, guys?

Welcome to my tailwind.

CC course.

So tailwind is utility first framework.

We'll talk more about what that means in a little bit.

But basically it gives you a ton of utility classes to work with and create layouts so that you barely

have to write any access at all.

And I was a little iffy when Tailwind first came out because of the number of classes that you have

to write.

But after working with it for a while over the past year or two, I've pretty much been using it nonstop

and it makes creating layouts easier and it makes it much faster as well.

So I wanted to create a project based course on it so that I can teach you guys to do the same thing.

And the only requirement for this is that you understand at least the basics of CC, so you don't have

to be a master at it, but you should know the common properties and you know the basics of Flexbox

stuff that you can just learn right on my YouTube crash courses.

Now, as far as the plan, I'm going to go over this more in the next video.

But we're going to start off by just creating a sandbox to learn what Tailwind has to offer as far as

classes and utilities.

Once we get through that, we're going to look at creating a more a more custom environment with the

Tailwind Sealy And I'll even show you how to set up Tailwind with Webpack and persistence if you want

to use it in your, you know, your custom JavaScript applications.

So after learning all the utility classes in the sandbox, we're going to start to build some stuff.

So we have five mini projects that we're going to start with.

And these are simple projects like pricing grids, a log model, a small image gallery layout, just

some things to kind of get your feet wet.

And then after that we have six landing page website projects and the designs were inspired by frontend

mentor Dot I oh, which is a challenge website.

So I talked to the owner.

He gave me permission to use some of the project designs in this course and I'll go through each project

in the next video and you can also see them live at tailwind from scratch dot com.

Now I do want to mention that writing classes in HTML can get kind of tedious and if you're following

along, you're going to going to be doing a lot of typing.

But I purposely didn't do much copying and pasting or anything like that because I want you guys to

get in the habit of typing out these classes.

The goal for this course is to get you to the point where you don't have to reference the Tailwind documentation

for anything.

You know, you know exactly what to do to get the layout that you want.

I would say that my favorite thing about Tailwind is just how quick you can not only create layouts

but also edit them and test different things out quickly.

And in order to do that, you need to remember most of the classes.

So we want to get those drilled into your brain.

All right.

So in the next video, we're going to take a look at all the projects and I'll explain the outline a

little more.
